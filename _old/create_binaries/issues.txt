* There is still problems with pyqt5...
It seems pyinstaller cannot work with the anaconda pyqt5 version. Luckly there are pip installers for all teh libraries. Execute before running.

pip install numpy matplotlib tables pandas pyqt5 h5py scipy scikit-learn scikit-image seaborn xlrd cython statsmodels numba keras tensorflow opencv-python-headless
pip install https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/tarball/develop

* the pip version of pytables and h5py are not compatible in python 3.5, but they are compatible for 3.6


* Version 3.2 does not import correctly pyqt5 in OSX (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1874). I had to download and install (python setup.py install) the development version (http://www.pyinstaller.org/).

* Got some issue related with different versions of libfreetype.6.dylib.
I can check this using:
	sudo find / -name libfreetype.6.dylib -exec otool -L {} \;

I find that I had an old version of PIL, and pyinstaller was pulling libfreetype.6.dylib. I deleted that folder (I installed too a new version of pillow, PIL seems discontinued).

-note: this problem can happends too with the libpng library, in this case it was matplotlib, that is installed with an older version and pyinstaller pull that one for some reason.

* the hidden import h5py._proxy requires quotations ('') in linux/mac but not in windows. Putting quotations in windows will confuse pyinstaller and will not be able to locate the file.

* use the options --windowed in Windows will cause problems in any subprocess. There seem to be some work arounds (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipe-subprocess), but for the moment I will just leave the annoying background screen in the application.

hiddenimports=['h5py.defs', 'h5py.utils', 'h5py.h5ac', 'h5py._proxy', 
             'cython', 'sklearn', 'sklearn.neighbors.typedefs'],

* For some reason the 'datas' parameter in analysis is not working. I have to add data to a.datas directly.


* I recieve a Intel MKL FATAL ERROR. Solution remove mkl from anaconda (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/2175).
	conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr
	conda remove mkl mkl-service

* I recieve an error of a missing package 'future'. Just use:
	conda install futures

* OSX the ffprobe of conda has relative links to the libraries and it is complicated to include in the binary. It is better to use the one of homebrew.

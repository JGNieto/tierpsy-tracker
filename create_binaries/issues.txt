* There seems to be a bug on pyinstaller 3.2 on mac (https://github.com/viotti/pyinstaller/commit/597af5cb01c064620b53ea1ee537e30f56fa481d#diff-fba1c2bf17d3fa95554d52e5747f25f9) For the momement I will use the version 3.1.1 until they fix that in the newest version.

* the hidden import h5py._proxy requires quotations ('') in linux/mac but not in windows. Putting quotations  in windows will confuse pyinstaller and will not be able to locate the file.

* use the options --windowed in Windows will cause problems in any subprocess. There seem to be some work arounds (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipe-subprocess), but for the moment I will just leave the annoying background screen in the application.

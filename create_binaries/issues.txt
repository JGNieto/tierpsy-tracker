* Version 3.2 does not import correctly pyqt5 in OSX (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1874). I had to download and install (python setup.py install) the development version (http://www.pyinstaller.org/).

* Got some issue related with different versions of libfreetype.6.dylib.
I can check this using:
	sudo find / -name libfreetype.6.dylib
	otool -L path_to_libfreetype

I find that I had an old version of PIL, and pyinstaller was pulling libfreetype.6.dylib. I deleted that folder (I installed too a new version of pillow, PIL seems discontinued).

* the hidden import h5py._proxy requires quotations ('') in linux/mac but not in windows. Putting quotations in windows will confuse pyinstaller and will not be able to locate the file.

* use the options --windowed in Windows will cause problems in any subprocess. There seem to be some work arounds (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipe-subprocess), but for the moment I will just leave the annoying background screen in the application.

hiddenimports=['h5py.defs', 'h5py.utils', 'h5py.h5ac', 'h5py._proxy', 
             'cython', 'sklearn', 'sklearn.neighbors.typedefs'],

** OLD ISSUES **
* There seems to be a bug on pyinstaller 3.2 on mac (https://github.com/viotti/pyinstaller/commit/597af5cb01c064620b53ea1ee537e30f56fa481d#diff-fba1c2bf17d3fa95554d52e5747f25f9) For the momement I will use the version 3.1.1 until they fix that in the newest version.

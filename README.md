# Multiworm_Tracking

This repository contains my work on the multiworm tracker for the [MRC-CSC](http://csc.mrc.ac.uk/) [Behavioral Genomics Group](http://behave.csc.mrc.ac.uk/).

The repository contains the following subfolders:

- **MWTracker:** Stable/Working package of the Multiworm tracker. More details on the algorithm and output data inside that folder.
- **examples:** Examples on how to use the tracker. Currently only shows how to process from data from a single video. There is one small sample video and its results in https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8Kl8D4WTGWGfjVJSmRBSmo3ZzMtaU1WQW00dElCVV9udDNaSEtTa05HRGZ3clFwQ25kQXc&usp=sharing.

- **parallelizeTasks:** Scripts used in the lab to process several files in parallel. 
- **work_on_progress:** Some new features or anything else I have been working on. This code might be changing constantly.

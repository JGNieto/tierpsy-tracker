# Multiworm_Tracking

This repository contains my work on the multiworm tracker for the [MRC-CSC](http://csc.mrc.ac.uk/) [Behavioral Genomics Group](http://behave.csc.mrc.ac.uk/).

The repository contains the following subfolders:

- **MWTracker:** Stable/Working package of the Multiworm tracker. More documentation inside that folder.
- **examples:** Examples on how to use the tracker. Currently only shows how to process from data from a single video.
- **parallelizeTasks:** Scripts used in the lab to process several files in parallel. 
- **work_on_progress:** Some new features or anything else I have been working on. This code might be changing constantly.
